### Q1: What is printed ?

Given a file `foo.jl` with the following code:
```julia
println("A - I am in foo.jl")

module Foo

println("B - I am in module Foo in foo.jl")
export x

const x=1
const y=2
z() = println("C - I am in a function of module Foo")
end

module Foo2

println("D - I am in module Foo2 in foo.jl")
export a

const a=1
const b=2
c() = println("E - I am in a function of module Foo2")
end
```

Which print statements will appear after running the command `include("foo.jl")` ?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "All statements from `A` to `E`", # hide
  "No statements will be printed (e.g. due to an error)", # hide
  "Statement `A` only", # hide
  "Statements `A`, `B` and `D` only", # hide
  "Statements `A`, `C` and `E` only", # hide
  "Statements `B` and `D` only", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [4]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```
Including the file would result in evaluating the code in the file and hence in the statements `A`, `B` and `D` to be printed.  Statements `C` and `E` are within function definition and would occur only when functions `z` or `c` would have been called.}

The correct answer is:
  - "No statements will be printed (e.g. due to an error)"

### Q2: Inclusion of a module

Given a file `foo.jl` with the following code:

```julia
module Foo

export x

const x=1
const y=2
z() = println("Hello world!")
end
```

and the following sequence of commands:

```julia
include("foo.jl")         # Command 1
x                         # Command 2
Foo.x                     # Command 3
using Foo                 # Command 4
using .Foo                # Command 5
x                         # Command 6
Foo.z()                   # Command 7
```

Which statements are correct ?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "Command 1 is wrong at it should have been `include foo` (without the .jl file extension)", # hide
  "Command 2 returns the value `1`", # hide
  "Command 3 returns the value `1`", # hide
  "Command 4 returns an `ArgumentError: Package Foo not found in current path:`", # hide
  "Command 5 returns an `ArgumentError: Package Foo not found in current path:`", # hide
  "Command 6 returns the value  `1`", # hide
  "Command 7 returns an `UndefVarError: z not defined`", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [3,4,6]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The `include("foo.jl")` statement evaluates the included content, but it doesn't yet bring it into scope. You can't yet refer directly to the objects of the `Foo` module, you need to use the qualified name as in command 3. `Foo` is a module, not a package, so command 4 will complain that it doesn't find the "package" `Foo`. After the module has been bring to scope we can refer to `x` directly as in command 6. Command 7, as we are using the qualified name, is indipenden than whether `z` was exported by `Foo` or not, and hence it works, and would have been worked even without the `using .Foo` of command 5.

The correct answers are:
  - "Command 3 returns the value `1`"
  - "Command 4 returns an `ArgumentError: Package Foo not found in current path:`"
  - "Command 6 returns the value  `1`"

### Q3: Submodules

Given a file `Foo.jl` with the following code:
```julia
module Foo
export x, plusOne
x = 1
plusOne(x) = x + 1
module Foo2
  export plusTwo
  plusTwo(x) = plusOne(x)+1
end
end
```

After including the file we try to run the command `Foo.Foo2.plusTwo(10)`. Which of the following statements is correct ?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "The result is 12", # hide
  "The result is 3", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if we run instead the command `Main.Foo.Foo2.plusTwo(10)`", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if we type `using Foo` before that command", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if we type `using .Foo` before that command", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if the function `plusTwo` in module `Foo2` is defined as `plusTwo(x) = Foo.plusOne(x)+1`", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if the function `plusTwo` in module `Foo2` is defined as `plusTwo(x) = Main.Foo.plusOne(x)+1`", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if in module `Foo2` the function `plusTwo` is preceded by the statement `using Foo`", # hide
  "The result is an error that we can avoid if in module `Foo2` the function `plusTwo` is preceded by the statement `using .Foo`", # hide
  " The result is an error that we can avoid if in module `Foo2` the function `plusTwo` is preceded by the statement `using ..Foo`", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [7,10]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```
The given command results in a `UndefVarError: plusOne not defined`. Indeed even if `Foo2` is a submodule of `Foo`, it doesn't inherit the scope of parent modules. So its code can't find the 'plusOne' function.  When in the REPL we run the command we are in the `Main` module. Adding `using .Foo` doesn't change anything, as the problem is in the scope of the `Foo2` module, not in those of the REPL (`Main` - and , of course, typing `using Foo` looks-up for the package `Foo`, not the module `Foo`, and would end in a `Package Foo not found` error. So what can we do? One solution is using in the `plusTwo` function the full path of the `plusOne` function:  `plusTwo(x) = Main.Foo.plusOne(x)+1`. While this works, it may be a less portable solution, as it then requires module Foo to be a child of `Main`. Perhaps a better solution is to use a relative path and use the statement `using ..Foo` in module `Foo2` before the definition of `plusTwo` (trying to use a relative path directly in the function definition as in `plusTwo(x) = ..Foo.plusOne(x)+1` would result in a parsing error)

The correct answers are:
  - The result is an error that we can avoid if the function `plusTwo` in module `Foo2` is defined as `plusTwo(x) = Main.Foo.plusOne(x)+1`
  - The result is an error that we can avoid if in module `Foo2` the function `plusTwo` is preceded by the statement `using ..Foo`

### Q4: Submodules2 

Given a module `Foo` with the following code:

```julia
module Foo
export x
x = 1
module Foo2
  export plusTwo
  plusTwo(x) = x+2
end
module Foo3
  export plusThree
  [XXXX]
  plusThree(x) = plusTwo(x)+1
  end                  
end
```

Which of the following statements are correct ?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `using Main.Foo.Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `using Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `using .Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `using ..Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `import Main.Foo.Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `import Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `import .Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  "`[XXXX]` should be `import ..Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [1,4]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```
 The function `plusTwo` needs to access a function on a sibling module. So the module `Foo2` must be retrieved by going up to one level with the two dots and then naming the module, i.e. `using ..Foo2` or using the full module path `using Main.Foo.Foo2`. `import` statemens alone will not work as the `plusThree` function call the `plusTwo` function using the unqualified name, without prefixing the module, so the `plusThree` function name need to be exported.

The correct answers are:
  - "`[XXXX]` should be `using Main.Foo.Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work"
  - "`[XXXX]` should be `using ..Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work"

### Q5: Reproducibility

Which elements do you have to provide to others to guarantee reproducibility of your results obtained with a Julia project?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "The input data of your analysis", # hide
  "The full source code of the scripts you have used", # hide
  "The content of the Julia user folder on the machine your code ran to produce the results (e.g. `/home/[username]/.julia` in Linux)", # hide
  "The file `Manifest.toml` of the environment where your code ran to produce the results", # hide
  "The file `Project.toml` of the environment where your code ran to produce the results", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [1,2,4]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```
To provide replicable results, assuming a deterministic algorithm or one where the random seed generator has been fixed, we need to provide the input data, the source code and the 'Manifest.toml' file that describe the _exact_ version of all packages. The `Project.toml` file instead, when present, is used to describe in which conditions our scripts could be used (i.e. the _list_ and eventually _range_ of dependent packages), but not a _unique_ environment state. The information of the `Manifest.toml` (and, for Julia versions before 1.7, the Julia version itself, as this info was not encoded in the `Manifest.toml` file) is enougth, we don't need to provide the whole content of the user Julia folder.

The correct answers are:
  - "The input data of your analysis"
  - "The full source code of the scripts you have used"
  - "The file `Manifest.toml` of the environment where your code ran to produce the results"
