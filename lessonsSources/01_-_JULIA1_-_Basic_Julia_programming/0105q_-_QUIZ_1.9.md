### Q1: Type theory

Which of the following sentences are correct ?

```@example q0109

choices = [ # hide
    "After a Type has been defined, it can no longer be redefined", # hide
    "Unless explicitly declared as mutable, composite types once created can no longer be modified", # hide
    "Unless explicitly declared as mutable, variables assigned to an object of a composite types once assigned can no longer be reassigned to another object", # hide
    "`x = MyType(1,2,3)` performs two operations: first it instantiates an object of type `Mytype` and then it assigns this object to the variable `x`", # hide
    "Primitive types cannot be declared child of an abstract type", # hide
    "Composite types cannot be declared child of an abstract type", # hide
    "Objects can not be instantiated out of an abstract type", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [1,2,4,7]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

Please look again the corresponding segment for clarifications.

The correct answers are:
  - After a Type has been defined, it can no longer be redefine
  - Unless explicitly declared as mutable, composite types once created can no longer be modified
  - `x = MyType(1,2,3)` performs two operations: first it instantiates an object of type `Mytype` and then it assigns this object to the variable `x`
  - Objects can not be instantiated out of an abstract type

### Q2: Type theory (2)

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
abstract type Aoo end
struct Foo
    f1::Int64
    f2::String
    end
```

Which of the following commands, taken individually, would rise an error?


```@example q0109

choices = [ # hide
    "`o = Foo(1,\"aaa\")`", # hide
    "`o = Foo(f1=1,f2=\"aaa\")`", # hide
    "`o = Aoo()`", # hide
    "`Foo(x,y) = Foo(y,x); Foo(\"aaa\",1)`", # hide
    "`o = Foo(2,\"bbb\"); println(o.f1)`", # hide
    "`o = Foo(2,\"bbb\"); o.f1 +=1`", # hide
] # hide
answers = [2,3,6]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

Concerning the commands raising an error: (1) the default constructor takes only positional arguments (in the order the type has been defined); (2) it is not possible to instantiate objects from an abstract type; (3) it is not possible to modify an immutable object

The correct answers are:
  - `o = Foo(f1=1,f2="aaa")`
  - `o = Aoo()`
  - `o = Foo(2,"bbb"); o.f1 +=1`

### Q3: "Types" of types

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
struct Foo{T<:Number}
  f1::T
  f2::T
end
```

Which properties are correct for `Foo`?

```@example q0109

choices = [ # hide
    "`Foo` is mutable", # hide
    "`Foo` is concrete", # hide
    "`Foo` is composite", # hide
    "`Foo` is parametric", # hide
    "`Foo{Int64`} is a bits type", # hide
    "`Foo{Int64`} is a child of `Foo{Number}`", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [2,3,4,5]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

Concerning the wrong sentences: (1) `Foo` is immutable, as it has not explicitly being declared `mutable`,(2) A parent/child relation in the template parameter type (here `Int64` being a child of `Number`) doesn't extent to an equivalent parent/child relation in the main parametric type. This has important consequences. If you want to define a function `foo` whose parameter `x` is a vector of numbers (integers, floats,...) rather than define your function as `foo(x::Vector{Number})` use instead `foo(x::Vector{T}) where {T<: Number}`. Even better, use `AbstractVector` unless you _really_ need to constrain the parameter to being a `Vector`.

The correct answers are:
  - `Foo` is concrete
  - `Foo` is composite
  - `Foo` is parametric
  - `Foo{Int64}` is a bits type

### Q4: Constructor of a parameteric type

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
struct Foo{T<:Number}
  f1::T
  f2::T
  function Foo(x::T,y::T) where {T<:Number}
    return XXXX(x,y)
  end
end
```

To what `XXXX` should be replaced for the giiven inner constructor to work (don't use spaces)?

```@example q0109

stringq(Regex("new{T}"))  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

Inner constructor use the keyword `new`. In this case, because we are dealing with a parametric type, the correct syntax is `new{T}(...arguments...)`

The correct answer is: `new{T}`
