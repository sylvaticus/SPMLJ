### Q1: Variables scope

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
x = 'a'
for c in "Hello World!"
  x = c
end
x
```

Which of the following sentences are true (assume a Julia version >= 1.5) ?

```@example q0107

choices = [ # hide
    "When the code is run in an interactive mode (e.g. on the REPL) an error is raised", # hide
    "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) an error is raised", # hide
    "When the code is run in an interactive mode (e.g. on the REPL) a warning is raised", # hide
    "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) a warning is raised", # hide
    "When the code is run in an interactive mode (e.g. on the REPL) x is now `!`", # hide
    "When the code is run in an interactive mode (e.g. on the REPL) x is now `a`", # hide
    "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) `x` is now `!`", # hide
    "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) `x` is now `a`", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [4,5,8]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide

```

When the script is run interactively, the `x` within the `for` block is the global variable, while when the code is run in a non interactive way `x` is a new local variable that shadows the global `x` variable and a warning is provided.

The correct answers are:
  - "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) a warning is raised"
  - "When the code is run in an interactive mode (e.g. on the REPL) `x` is now `!`"
  - "When the code is run in an non-interactive mode (e.g. the whole script is on an imported file) `x` is now `a`"

### Q2: Nested for loops

Given that the following code snippet:

```julia
for i = 2:6
  k = round(Int64,i/2)
  for j = 4:-1:XXX
    println(j)
  end
end
```

prints the sequence `4,3,2,4,3,4`, what is `XXX` in the code ?

```@example q0107

stringq(Regex("i")) # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The inner loop starts at `4` and then continues in reverse order until it reaches the value of the outer loop, first `2`, then `3` and finally `4`. For `i`s over `4`, the inner loop is never executed. Remember that in a range, in Julia, both the extremes are included.

The correct answer is: `i`

### Q3: Conditional statements

Given that `c=10`, which of the following statements, taken individually, would lead to `v` being equal to `100` ?

```@example q0107

choices = [ # hide
    "`v = (c < 10) ? 1 : 100`", # hide
    "`(c >= 10) && (v = 100)`", # hide
    "`(c >= 10) || (v = 100)`", # hide
    "`(c < 10) && (v = 100)`", # hide
    "`(c < 10) || (v = 100)`", # hide
    "`if (c >= 10) v = 100 end`", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [1,2,5,6]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

 When we test for `c >= 10`, we obtain something already `true` and hence the second part (the `v` assignment) is evaluated only  with and _end_ operator (`&&`), and the converse is true when we check for `c < 10` where the second part is evaluated only with an _or_ operator (`||`).

The correct answers are:
  - `v = (c < 10) ? 1 : 100`
  - `(c >= 10) && (v = 100)`
  - `(c < 10) || (v = 100)`
  - `if (c >= 10) v = 100 end`
