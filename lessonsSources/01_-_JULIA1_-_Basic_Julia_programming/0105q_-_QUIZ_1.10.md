### Q1: Inheritance and call dispatch

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
abstract type Foo end
struct Aaa <: Foo end
struct Bbb <: Foo end
struct Ccc end
foo(x::Foo) = println("Hello")
foo(x::Aaa) = println("Good day!")
foo(x)      = print("Welcome!")
```

Match the following commands with their corresponding outputs.

```@example q0110

println("aaa")

questions = [ # hide
    "`foo(Foo())`", # hide
    "`foo(Aaa())`", # hide
    "`foo(Bbb())`", # hide
    "`foo(Ccc())`", # hide
] # hide
choices = [ # hide
    "Good Day", # hide
    "Hello", # hide
    "(Error)", # hide
    "Welcome!", # hide
] # hide
answers = (3,1,2,4)  # hide
println("bbb")

matchq(questions, choices, answers) # hide
println("ccc")

```

We can't initialise an object from an abstract type, so `foo(Foo())` raises an error. The other calls follow the rule that the method dispatched is the one stricted (more restrictive, in terms of parameters types) for which there is a match.

The correct matches are:
  - `foo(Foo())` -> Error
  - `foo(Aaa())` -> "Good Day"
  - `foo(Bbb())` -> "Hello"
  - `foo(Ccc())` -> "Welcome!"

### Q2: Composition

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
struct Address
  road
  city
  country
end
struct CompanyData
  name
  address::Address
  revenues
end
struct Farm
  cData::CompanyData
  agrArea
  livUnits
end
```

Which of the following sentences are correct ?

```@example q0110

choices = [ # hide
    "The snippet emploies a composition design principle", # hide
    "The snippet emploies an inheritance design principle", # hide
    "To build a `Farm` object I can use the constructor call `Farm(\"Future Farm\",\"Road of farms\",\"Smalltown\",\"Joyland\",10000,100,0)`", # hide
    "To build a `Farm` object I can use the constructor call `Farm(CompanyData(\"Future Farm\",Address(\"Road of farms\",\"Smalltown\",\"Joyland\"),10000),100,0)`", # hide
    "I can simplify the creation of objects by implementing a custom constructor", # hide
    "To access the country of farm `farmABC` we can use the syntax `farmABC.cData.address.country`", # hide
    "To access the country of farm `farmABC` we can use the syntax `farmABC[cData][address][country]`", # hide
    "To access the country of farm `farmABC` we can use `@pipe getfield(aFarm,:cData) |> getfield(_,:address) |> getfield(_,:country)` provided the package `Pipe` is installed and loaded", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [1,4,5,6,8]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

The design principle used in the code is _composition_ and [it has several advantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) over _inheritance_. The default constructor leads to very verbose syntax, but this could be largely simplified by writing a custom constructor. To access the fields of our object we can use the dot notation (eventually chained) or explicitly call `getField(obj,:fieldName)`. The answer uses a useful package that extends the default pipe operator of Julia. 

The correct answers are:
  - The snippet emploies a composition design principle
  - To build a `Farm` object I can use the constructor call `Farm(CompanyData("Future Farm",Address("Road of farms","Smalltown","Joyland"),10000),100,0)`
  - I can simplify the creation of objects by implementing a custom constructor
  - To access the country of farm `farmABC` we can use the syntax `farmABC.cData.address.country`
  - To access the country of farm `farmABC` we can use `@pipe getfield(aFarm,:cData) |> getfield(_,:address) |> getfield(_,:country)` provided the package `Pipe` is installed and loaded
